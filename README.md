This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## Motivation

There's many hard tutorial about the key concept of react-redux, so this repo is help you to understand redux (thunk, react-redux)


## For what

Actually why we have to use redux? It's simply to manage our state in a clean way and do caching, etc which in plain way/normal flow will be a bit difficult, even the goals are same.
- thunk (for method type action + async process)
- redux (basic think that we need to `reduxing` our app)
- react-redux (wrapper for react and redux to do a communication)


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
